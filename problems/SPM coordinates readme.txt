(1) The coordinate file takes form of [x y delta_x delta_y] where x is the horizontal axis in the 2D plane and the second dim in the ndarray, and y is the vertical axis in the 2D plane and the first dim in the ndarray.

(2) The coordinates are arranged in the natural order of the names of images (rather than alphanumeric order).
